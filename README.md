# Daily Schedule for OS Tutorial Summer of Code 2024

## Day 1 2024.4.7

### Read the R-core tutorial book Chapter 0: Abstraction Layer of Operating System

### Begin to read the tutorial book for Rust Programming language

The link for the tutorial book is here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html

My hardware is mac-os, so I just use this command:  

'''shell
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
'''

successfully printed "hello world" to the command line
